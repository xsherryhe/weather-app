This project is an app that displays weather forecasts for any location in the world. It is built using the standard front-end stack of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project primarily demonstrates use of asynchronous JS with APIs, including the Fetch API, promises, and async/await syntax.

The project is currently in progress. In order to keep the API keys secure in a front-end-only application, this project will not be deployed online.
